## Technical_Criteria


- When I load the portfolio then I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
- When I click one of the links in the navigation the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- When I click on the link to the section about their work then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
- When I am presented with the developer's first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
- When I click on the images of the applications then I am taken to that deployed application.
- When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices then I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
